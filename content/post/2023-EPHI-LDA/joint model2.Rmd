### <span style="color: #008080;">Joint Models for Longitudinal and Time-to-Event Data</span>

- What is <span style="color: #800000;">Joint Modelling?</span>

- a <span style="color: #2ca02c;">joint modeling approach</span> to analyze two types of outcomes often observed in longitudinal studies:
 
  - A set of <span style="color: #2ca02c;">longitudinal response measurements</span>.
  - The <span style="color: #2ca02c;">time to an event</span> of interest, such as default, death, etc.

- Traditionally, these two outcomes have been analyzed separately:
 
  - Using a <span style="color: #2ca02c;">mixed effects model</span> for the longitudinal response.
  - A <span style="color: #2ca02c;">survival model</span> for the time-to-event.

- However, in this section, we will explore how these outcomes can be <span style="color: #2ca02c;">analyzed jointly</span>.

---

**<span style="color: #1f77b4;">Overview of survival or time to event</span>**

- Survival analysis is a set of <span style="color: #2ca02c;">statistical techniques</span> designed for analyzing data where the outcome variable is the time until an event occurs. 

- This event time is often referred to as <span style="color: #2ca02c;">failure time</span>, <span style="color: #2ca02c;">survival time</span>, or <span style="color: #2ca02c;">event time</span>.

- <span style="color: #2ca02c;">Survival time</span> signifies the time from a specific starting point (e.g., treatment initiation) to a particular endpoint (time-to-event).


- <span style="color: #1f77b4;">Time, Time Origin, Time Scale, Event</span>

In survival analysis, the definition of an individual's <span style="color: #2ca02c;">failure time</span> requires three elements:

1. **Time Origin**: The starting point for measuring time.
2. **Time Scale**: The units used for measuring time (e.g., years, months, days).
3. **Event**: The specific occurrence of interest (e.g., death, disease incidence, default).
---

- For biomedical applications, this could involve events like <span style="color: #ff7f0e;">death</span> or <span style="color: #ff7f0e;">disease incidence</span>.
- In fields like credit scoring, it might be <span style="color: #ff7f0e;">default</span>, and in engineering, it could be <span style="color: #ff7f0e;">component failure</span>.

When considering multiple events, such as various causes of death, the problem can involve <span style="color: #ff7f0e;">recurrent events</span> or <span style="color: #ff7f0e;">competing risks</span>.

**<span style="color: #1f77b4;">Goals of Survival Analysis</span>**

The primary objectives of survival analysis include:

1. <span style="color: #2ca02c;">Estimating Time-to-Event:</span> estimate the time it takes for an event to occur for a <span style="color: #ff7f0e;">group of individuals</span>. 

2. <span style="color: #2ca02c;">Comparing Time-to-Event </span> between <span style="color: #ff7f0e;">two or more groups</span>. 

3. <span style="color: #2ca02c;">Assessing Covariate Relationships:</span> to assess how <span style="color: #ff7f0e;">covariates</span> relate to the time-to-event. 
---

### <span style="color:blue">Censoring</span>

- The distinguishing feature of survival analysis is that it incorporates a phenomenon called censoring. 

- Censoring occurs when we have some information about individual survival time, but we donâ€™t know the time exactly.


```{r, out.width='50%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Image/censor.png")
```

---

### <span style="color:blue">Kaplan-Meier (KM) Curves:</span>

- a graphical representation of the estimated survival probability over time.
- visualize how the survival probability changes as time progresses.
- typically stratified by different groups, allowing comparisons between these groups.

### <span style="color:red">Log-Rank Test:</span>

- The Log-Rank test is statistical test used to compare the survival distributions of two or more groups.
- It assesses whether there are significant differences in survival times between the groups.
- The test is based on comparing the observed number of events and expected number of events under the null hypothesis of equal survival distributions.

---

### <span style="color:blue">Pros and Cons of the Kaplan-Meier Estimator</span>

 <span style="color:green">Pros:</span>

- It is commonly used to describe survival.
- It is commonly used to compare two study populations.
- It provides an intuitive graphical presentation of survival data.

<span style="color:red">Cons:</span>

- It is mainly descriptive in nature.
- It does not control for covariates or other factors that may influence survival.
- It cannot accommodate time-dependent variables in its basic form.


---

### The Cox Proportional Hazard Model

- The Cox proportional hazard model provides the following benefits:

- Adjusts for multiple risk factors simultaneously.

- Allows quantitative (continuous) risk factors, helping to limit the number of strata.

- Provides estimates and confidence intervals of how the risk changes across the strata and across unit increases in quantitative variables.

- Can handle data sets with right censoring, staggered entry, etc.; so long as we have adequate data at each time point.

---

- The proportional hazard function has the form:

- $h(t) = h_0(t) e^{\beta_1 x_1 + \ldots + \beta_p x_p}$
   Where $h_0$ is the baseline hazard rate, i.e., $x_1 = 0, x_2 = 0,$ etc.

- Note that the ratio of 2 hazard functions does not depend on $t$.

```{r, out.width='50%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Image/coxassumption.png")
```
---

### Time-Varying Covariates

- Often, there is interest in the association between a time-varying covariate and the risk of an event.
 
  - Treatment changes with time (e.g., dose)
 
  - Time-dependent exposure (e.g., smoking, diet)
 
  - Markers of disease or patient condition (e.g., blood pressure, PSA levels)

**Example: PBC Study**

- In the PBC study, we explore if longitudinal bilirubin measurements are associated with the hazard of death.

---

### <span style="color: #1f77b4;">Time-Varying Covariates</span>

- To address our questions of interest, we must formulate a model that connects:
  - Serum bilirubin levels
  - Time-to-death

#### <span style="color: #ff7f0e;">Association with Baseline Marker Levels</span>

- The connection between baseline marker levels and the risk of death can be assessed using standard statistical methods, such as Cox regression.

#### <span style="color: #2ca02c;">Study of Time-Varying Covariates</span>

- When examining time-varying covariates, more careful consideration is essential.

---

### <span style="color: #1f77b4;">Types of Time-Varying Covariates</span>

- There are two types of time-varying covariates (Kalbfleisch & Prentice, 2002):
  - **<span style="color: #ff7f0e;">External (aka exogenous)</span>:** The value of the covariate at time point t is not affected by the occurrence of an event at time point u, with t > u.
  - **<span style="color: #2ca02c;">Internal (aka endogenous)</span>:** The covariate is not External.

- <span style="color: #1f77b4;">Example: External vs. Internal</span>

- This concept can be challenging to grasp, so let's clarify with an example...

---

#### <span style="color: #1f77b4;">Example: Asthma Study</span>

- Let's consider a study on asthma, specifically focusing on the time until an asthma attack for a group of patients.

- We have two time-varying covariates:
  - **<span style="color: #ff7f0e;">Pollution levels</span>**
  - **<span style="color: #2ca02c;">A biomarker for asthma</span>**

#### <span style="color: #1f77b4;">Pollution Levels and Biomarker</span>

- Suppose a patient had an asthma attack at a certain time point, denoted as u.

- For the time-varying covariates:
  - **<span style="color: #ff7f0e;">Pollution levels:</span>** The pollution levels at a time point t > u will not be affected by the fact that the patient had an attack at u. (External)
  - **<span style="color: #2ca02c;">Biomarker:</span>** The biomarker level at a time point t > u may be affected by the fact that the patient had an attack at u. (Internal)
  
---

#### <span style="color: #1f77b4;">Distinguishing Covariate Types</span>

- It's <span style="color: #ff7f0e;">crucial</span> to differentiate between these two types of time-varying covariates, as the type of covariate determines the appropriate analysis.

- In our motivating examples, all time-varying covariates are <span style="color: #2ca02c;">Biomarkers</span>. These are always <span style="color: #2ca02c;">endogenous</span> covariates:
  
  - <span style="color: #ff7f0e;">Measured with error</span> (i.e., biological variation)
  
  - The <span style="color: #ff7f0e;">complete history is not available</span>
  
  - Existence is <span style="color: #ff7f0e;">directly related to failure status</span>

---

### <span style="color: #1f77b4;">Extension of Cox Model for Time-Varying Covariates</span>

- The Cox model presented earlier can be extended to handle time-varying covariates using the counting process formulation:

$$h_i(t | Y_i(t), w_i) = h_0(t)R_i(t) \exp\{ \gamma^T w_i +\color{#2ca02c}{ \alpha y_i(t)} \}$$

where:
- $\color{blue}{N_i(t)}$ is a counting process that tracks the number of events for subject $i$ by time $t$,

- $h_i(t)$ denotes the intensity process for $N_i(t)$,

- $R_i(t)$ denotes the at-risk process (equals 1 if subject $i$ is still at risk at time $t$),

- $\color{#2ca02c}{y_i(t)}$denotes the value of the time-varying covariate for subject $i$ at time $t$.


- This formulation allows for the incorporation of time-varying covariates into the Cox model.

---

#### <span style="color: #1f77b4;">Interpretation</span>

The formulation:

$h_i(t | Y_i(t), w_i) = h_0(t)R_i(t) \exp\{ \gamma^T w_i + \alpha y_i(t) \}$

has the following interpretation:
- The term $\exp(\alpha)$ denotes the <span style="color: #2ca02c;">relative increase</span> in the risk of an event at time $t$ that results from a <span style="color: #ff7f0e;">one-unit increase</span> in $y_i(t)$ at the <span style="color: #ff7f0e;">same time point</span>.

---

#### <span style="color: #1f77b4;">Handling Time-Varying Covariates in the Extended Cox Model</span>

The extended Cox model handles time-varying covariates as follows:
- It <span style="color: #2ca02c;">assumes no measurement error</span>.
- The covariate path is represented by a <span style="color: #2ca02c;">step function</span>.
- The <span style="color: #2ca02c;">existence</span> of the covariate is <span style="color: #2ca02c;">not related to failure status</span>.

**<span style="color: #1f77b4;">Validity of the Extended Cox Model</span>**

- The extended Cox model is <span style="color: #2ca02c;">valid</span> only for <span style="color: #2ca02c;">exogenous time-varying covariates</span>.

- Treating <span style="color: #ff7f0e;">endogenous covariates</span> as exogenous <span style="color: #ff7f0e;">may produce spurious results</span>!
---

### <span style="color: #1f77b4;">Joint Modeling Framework</span>

- To account for the special features of <span style="color: #ff7f0e;">endogenous covariates</span>, a new class of models has been developed: **Joint Models for Longitudinal and Time-to-Event Data**.

- The intuitive idea behind these models:
  1. Use an appropriate model to describe the <span style="color: #2ca02c;">evolution of the covariate/marker</span> over time for each patient.
  2. The <span style="color: #2ca02c;">estimated evolutions</span> are then used in a Cox model.

- A key feature of these models is that <span style="color: #2ca02c;">covariate levels are not assumed constant between visits</span>.

---

#### <span style="color: #1f77b4;">Notation</span>

- Some notation:
  - $\color{#ff7f0e}{T_i^*}$: True event time for patient $i$
 
  - $\color{#ff7f0e}{T_i}$: Observed event time for patient $i$
 
  - $\color{#ff7f0e}{\delta_i}$: Event indicator, i.e., equals 1 for true events
 
  - $\color{#2ca02c}{y_i}$: Longitudinal covariate
  
- We will formulate the joint model in 3 steps â€“ in particular, . . .

---

#### <span style="color: #1f77b4;">Step 1: Formulation of Joint Model</span>

- Step 1: Let's assume that we know $\color{#ff7f0e}{m_i(t)}$, i.e., the true and unobserved value of the covariate at time $t$.

- With this assumption, we can define a <span style="color: #2ca02c;">standard relative risk model</span>:

  $$h_i(t | M_i(t)) = h_0(t) \exp\{ \gamma^T w_i + \color{#ff7f0e}{\alpha m_i(t)} \},$$
  where:
  
  - $\color{#ff7f0e}{M_i(t) = \{ m_i(s), 0 \leq s < t \}}$ represents the longitudinal history,
  
  - $\color{#2ca02c}{\alpha}$ quantifies the association between the time-varying covariate and the risk of an event,
  
  - $\color{#ff7f0e}{w_i}$ represents the baseline covariates.

---

#### <span style="color: #1f77b4;">Step 2: Reconstructing Covariate History</span>

- Step 2: From the observed longitudinal data $\color{#2ca02c}{y_i(t)}$, reconstruct the covariate history for each subject.

- We use a <span style="color: #2ca02c;">mixed effects model</span> to achieve this (focusing on continuous covariates for now):
 $$y_i(t) = \color{blue}{m_i(t)} + \epsilon_i(t)$$
  $$= \color{blue}{x_i(t)^T \beta + z_i(t)^T b_i} + \epsilon_i(t),$$
  where:
  
  - $\color{#ff7f0e}{x_i(t)}$ and $\color{#ff7f0e}{\beta}$: Fixed-effects part,
 
  - $\color{blue}{z_i(t)}$ and $\color{blue}{b_i}$: Random-effects part, $\color{#ff7f0e}{b_i \sim N(0, D)}$, $\color{#ff7f0e}{\epsilon_i(t) \sim N(0, \sigma^2)}$.

---

#### <span style="color:blue">Step 3: Associating the Two Processes and Defining a Joint Distribution Model</span>

Joint models for associating two processes are often structured as follows (Tsiatis & Davidian, Stat. Sinica, 2004):

The joint distribution is given by:
$$p(y_i, T_i, \delta_i) = Z p(y_i | b_i) h(T_i | b_i)^{\delta_i} S(T_i | b_i) p(b_i) \, db_i,$$

where:
- $b_i$ is a vector of random effects that explains the interdependencies.

- $p(\cdot)$ represents the density function.
- $S(\cdot)$ represents the survival function.
- $Z$ represents any normalizing constant.

This structure allows us to define a model for the joint distribution of the two processes.

---

#### <span style="color:blue">Analysis of a Real Data Example Using JM</span>

- Consider a <span style="color:green">longitudinal study</span> on 467 HIV infected patients who had failed or were intolerant of zidovudine therapy.

- Aim:  <span style="color:green">compare the efficacy and safety</span> of two alternative antiretroviral drugs: **<span style="color:red">didanosine (ddI) and zalcitabine (ddC)</span>**.

- Patients were randomly assigned to receive either ddI or ddC, and <span style="color:blue">CD4 cell counts</span> were recorded at study entry and at 2, 6, 12, and 18 months thereafter.
   - By the end of the study, <span style="color:red">188 patients had died</span>, resulting in <span style="color:red">59.7% censoring</span>.

- Our <span style="color:green">main research question</span> is to test for a treatment effect on survival after adjusting for the CD4 cell count.

- "The <span style="color:blue">CD4 cell count measurements</span> are <span style="color:blue">generated by patients</span> and are <span style="color:blue">only available at specific visit times</span>. 
    - This situation exemplifies a typical <span style="color:green">time-dependent covariate</span>, measured <span style="color:green">intermittently with error</span>."

---

- The <span style="color:green">longitudinal and survival information</span> is available in the data frames `aids` and `aids.id` respectively.

- The CD4 cell counts exhibit <span style="color:red">right-skewed distribution shapes</span>; for analysis, we work with the <span style="color:red">square root</span> of the CD4 cell values.

- As a descriptive analysis, <span style="color:purple">Figure 1</span> shows <span style="color:purple">subject-specific longitudinal profiles</span> and the <span style="color:purple">Kaplan-Meier estimate</span> for time-to-death.

---

#### <span style="color:blue">Descriptive Analysis - Longitudinal Profiles and Survival</span>

To perform a <span style="color:green">descriptive analysis</span> of the data, we can visualize the longitudinal profiles and survival curves using R and the `JM` and `lattice` libraries.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=4.5, fig.align='center'}
library("JM"); library("lattice")
xyplot(sqrt(CD4) ~ obstime | drug, group = patient, data = aids,
       xlab = "Months", ylab = expression(sqrt("CD4")), col = 1, type = "l")
```
---

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=5.5, fig.align='center'}
# Survival Curves
plot(survfit(Surv(Time, death) ~ drug, data = aids.id), conf.int = FALSE,
     mark.time = TRUE, col = c("black", "red"), lty = 1:2,
     ylab = "Survival", xlab = "Months")
legend("topright", c("ddC", "ddI"), lty = 1:2, col = c("black", "red"),
       bty = "n")
```

---

#### <span style="color:blue">Observations and Initial Analysis</span>

- We observe that <span style="color:green">both groups</span> of patients exhibit <span style="color:green">similar variability</span> in their longitudinal profiles.

- However, from the <span style="color:purple">Kaplan-Meier estimate </span>, it appears that the <span style="color:blue">ddC group</span> has slightly <span style="color:blue">higher survival</span> than the ddI group after six months of follow-up.

- To highlight the advantages of the joint modelling approach, we will begin with a <span style="color:red">'naive' analysis</span>. 

- In this analysis, we <span style="color:red">ignore the special characteristics</span> of CD4 cell counts and fit a Cox model that includes the treatment indicator and CD4 as a typical time-dependent covariate.

---

- We will use the <span style="color:orange">standard counting process form</span> of the Cox model to fit this analysis:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
td.Cox <- coxph(Surv(start, stop, event) ~ drug + sqrt(CD4), data = aids)
summary(td.Cox)
```

---

#### <span style="color:blue">Advanced Analysis - Fitting a Joint Model</span>

- After adjusting for the <span style="color:green">square root of CD4 count</span> in the Cox model, <span style="color:red">no strong evidence</span> for a treatment effect is observed.

- We proceed by <span style="color:green">specifying and fitting a joint model</span> that explicitly postulates a linear mixed-effects model for CD4 cell counts.

- <span style="color:green">Taking advantage</span> of the randomization setup of the study, we include in the fixed-effects part of the <span style="color:green">longitudinal submodel</span> the main effect of time and the interaction of treatment with time.

- In the random-effects design matrix, we include an intercept and a time term.

- For the <span style="color:green">survival submodel</span> (similarly to the Cox model), we include the treatment effect as a time-independent covariate, and as a time-dependent one, the <span style="color:green">true underlying effect</span> of CD4 cell count estimated from the longitudinal model.

- The <span style="color:green">baseline risk function</span> is assumed piecewise constant with <span style="color:green">six knots</span> placed at equally spaced percentiles of the observed event times.

---

#### <span style="color:blue">Fitting the Joint Model</span>

- To fit the joint model, a <span style="color:green">two-step process</span> is followed. First, the linear mixed-effects and Cox models are fitted <span style="color:green">separately</span>.

- The <span style="color:green">returned objects</span> from these separate fits are then used as main arguments in the `jointModel()` function.

- Importantly, the structure of the joint model for the <span style="color:green">longitudinal and survival submodels</span> mirrors that of the separately fitted models.

- In the survival submodel, the <span style="color:green">estimated 'true' longitudinal outcome</span> $m_i(t)$ is incorporated into the linear predictor.

- Due to the fact that `jointModel()` extracts necessary information from these two objects, in the `coxph()` function call, we must specify `x = TRUE` to include the <span style="color:orange">Cox model's design matrix</span> in the returned object.

#### <span style="color:blue">Interpreting Joint Model Results</span>

- The <span style="color:orange">main argument `timeVar` of `jointModel()`</span> specifies the name of the time variable in the linear mixed-effects model. 
  - This is vital for the computation of $m_i(t)$.

- The `summary()` method <span style="color:orange">provides a detailed output</span>, including parameter estimates, their standard errors, and asymptotic Wald tests for both the longitudinal and survival submodels.

- In the <span style="color:purple">event process results</span>, the parameter labeled **Assoct** corresponds to parameter $\alpha$. 
   - It measures the effect of $m_i(t)$ (in our case, the true square root CD4 cell count) on the risk of death. 

The parameters $x_i$ are (for $i = 1, \ldots, 7$) parameters for the piecewise constant baseline risk function.

---

- A comparison between the <span style="color:green">standard time-dependent Cox model</span> and the <span style="color:green">joint model</span> reveals interesting features.

- The regression coefficient for <span style="color:blue">ddI is larger in magnitude</span> in the joint model, indicating a slightly <span style="color:blue">stronger treatment effect</span>.

- A significant <span style="color:blue">bias</span> is observed for the <span style="color:blue">CD4 cell count effect</span>. 

- In the time-dependent Cox model, the estimated regression coefficient is $-0.72$, whereas in the joint model, it's $-1.10$.

- For obtaining the Hazard Ratio for this variable we have to exponenciate the value exposed in the table. 
- In this case the result is 0.33. According to this, one unit increse on the CD4 count cell decreases the risk 67%.

#### <span style="color:blue">Alternative Test - Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT)</span>

- The <span style="color:blue">Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT)</span> provides an alternative to the Wald test for hypothesis testing.

- After fitting the joint model under the null hypothesis of <span style="color:red">no treatment effect</span> in the survival submodel, we can use the <span style="color:orange">`anova()` method</span> to perform the LRT:

```{r}
# Null Hypothesis Testing
fitSURV2 <- coxph(Surv(Time, death) ~ 1, data = aids.id, x = TRUE)
fitJM2 <- jointModel(fitLME, fitSURV2, timeVar = "obstime", method = "piecewise-PH-GH")
anova(fitJM2, fitJM) # The model under the null is the first one
```

- According to the `pvalue` (as with the Wald test) we arrive to the same conclusion, there exist an affect of the treatment on the risk.
---
- Additionally, if we want to obtain estimates of the Hazard Ratio with confidence intervals for the final model it is possible ti apply the `confint` function to the created object

```{r}
confint(fitJM, parm = "Event")
exp(confint(fitJM, parm = "Event"))
```
