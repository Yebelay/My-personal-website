### &lt;span style="color: #008080;"&gt;Joint Models for Longitudinal and Time-to-Event Data&lt;/span&gt;

- What is &lt;span style="color: #800000;"&gt;Joint Modelling?&lt;/span&gt;

- a &lt;span style="color: #2ca02c;"&gt;joint modeling approach&lt;/span&gt; to analyze two types of outcomes often observed in longitudinal studies:
 
  - A set of &lt;span style="color: #2ca02c;"&gt;longitudinal response measurements&lt;/span&gt;.
  - The &lt;span style="color: #2ca02c;"&gt;time to an event&lt;/span&gt; of interest, such as default, death, etc.

- Traditionally, these two outcomes have been analyzed separately:
 
  - Using a &lt;span style="color: #2ca02c;"&gt;mixed effects model&lt;/span&gt; for the longitudinal response.
  - A &lt;span style="color: #2ca02c;"&gt;survival model&lt;/span&gt; for the time-to-event.

- However, in this section, we will explore how these outcomes can be &lt;span style="color: #2ca02c;"&gt;analyzed jointly&lt;/span&gt;.

---

**&lt;span style="color: #1f77b4;"&gt;Overview of survival or time to event&lt;/span&gt;**

- Survival analysis is a set of &lt;span style="color: #2ca02c;"&gt;statistical techniques&lt;/span&gt; designed for analyzing data where the outcome variable is the time until an event occurs. 

- This event time is often referred to as &lt;span style="color: #2ca02c;"&gt;failure time&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="color: #2ca02c;"&gt;survival time&lt;/span&gt;, or &lt;span style="color: #2ca02c;"&gt;event time&lt;/span&gt;.

- &lt;span style="color: #2ca02c;"&gt;Survival time&lt;/span&gt; signifies the time from a specific starting point (e.g., treatment initiation) to a particular endpoint (time-to-event).


- &lt;span style="color: #1f77b4;"&gt;Time, Time Origin, Time Scale, Event&lt;/span&gt;

In survival analysis, the definition of an individual's &lt;span style="color: #2ca02c;"&gt;failure time&lt;/span&gt; requires three elements:

1. **Time Origin**: The starting point for measuring time.
2. **Time Scale**: The units used for measuring time (e.g., years, months, days).
3. **Event**: The specific occurrence of interest (e.g., death, disease incidence, default).
---

- For biomedical applications, this could involve events like &lt;span style="color: #ff7f0e;"&gt;death&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span style="color: #ff7f0e;"&gt;disease incidence&lt;/span&gt;.
- In fields like credit scoring, it might be &lt;span style="color: #ff7f0e;"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;, and in engineering, it could be &lt;span style="color: #ff7f0e;"&gt;component failure&lt;/span&gt;.

When considering multiple events, such as various causes of death, the problem can involve &lt;span style="color: #ff7f0e;"&gt;recurrent events&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span style="color: #ff7f0e;"&gt;competing risks&lt;/span&gt;.

**&lt;span style="color: #1f77b4;"&gt;Goals of Survival Analysis&lt;/span&gt;**

The primary objectives of survival analysis include:

1. &lt;span style="color: #2ca02c;"&gt;Estimating Time-to-Event:&lt;/span&gt; estimate the time it takes for an event to occur for a &lt;span style="color: #ff7f0e;"&gt;group of individuals&lt;/span&gt;. 

2. &lt;span style="color: #2ca02c;"&gt;Comparing Time-to-Event &lt;/span&gt; between &lt;span style="color: #ff7f0e;"&gt;two or more groups&lt;/span&gt;. 

3. &lt;span style="color: #2ca02c;"&gt;Assessing Covariate Relationships:&lt;/span&gt; to assess how &lt;span style="color: #ff7f0e;"&gt;covariates&lt;/span&gt; relate to the time-to-event. 
---

### &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;Censoring&lt;/span&gt;

- The distinguishing feature of survival analysis is that it incorporates a phenomenon called censoring. 

- Censoring occurs when we have some information about individual survival time, but we don’t know the time exactly.


&lt;img src="Image/censor.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

### &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;Kaplan-Meier (KM) Curves:&lt;/span&gt;

- a graphical representation of the estimated survival probability over time.
- visualize how the survival probability changes as time progresses.
- typically stratified by different groups, allowing comparisons between these groups.

### &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;Log-Rank Test:&lt;/span&gt;

- The Log-Rank test is statistical test used to compare the survival distributions of two or more groups.
- It assesses whether there are significant differences in survival times between the groups.
- The test is based on comparing the observed number of events and expected number of events under the null hypothesis of equal survival distributions.

---

### &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;Pros and Cons of the Kaplan-Meier Estimator&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;Pros:&lt;/span&gt;

- It is commonly used to describe survival.
- It is commonly used to compare two study populations.
- It provides an intuitive graphical presentation of survival data.

&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;Cons:&lt;/span&gt;

- It is mainly descriptive in nature.
- It does not control for covariates or other factors that may influence survival.
- It cannot accommodate time-dependent variables in its basic form.


---

### The Cox Proportional Hazard Model

- The Cox proportional hazard model provides the following benefits:

- Adjusts for multiple risk factors simultaneously.

- Allows quantitative (continuous) risk factors, helping to limit the number of strata.

- Provides estimates and confidence intervals of how the risk changes across the strata and across unit increases in quantitative variables.

- Can handle data sets with right censoring, staggered entry, etc.; so long as we have adequate data at each time point.

---

- The proportional hazard function has the form:

- `\(h(t) = h_0(t) e^{\beta_1 x_1 + \ldots + \beta_p x_p}\)`
   Where `\(h_0\)` is the baseline hazard rate, i.e., `\(x_1 = 0, x_2 = 0,\)` etc.

- Note that the ratio of 2 hazard functions does not depend on `\(t\)`.

&lt;img src="Image/coxassumption.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---

### Time-Varying Covariates

- Often, there is interest in the association between a time-varying covariate and the risk of an event.
 
  - Treatment changes with time (e.g., dose)
 
  - Time-dependent exposure (e.g., smoking, diet)
 
  - Markers of disease or patient condition (e.g., blood pressure, PSA levels)

**Example: PBC Study**

- In the PBC study, we explore if longitudinal bilirubin measurements are associated with the hazard of death.

---

### &lt;span style="color: #1f77b4;"&gt;Time-Varying Covariates&lt;/span&gt;

- To address our questions of interest, we must formulate a model that connects:
  - Serum bilirubin levels
  - Time-to-death

#### &lt;span style="color: #ff7f0e;"&gt;Association with Baseline Marker Levels&lt;/span&gt;

- The connection between baseline marker levels and the risk of death can be assessed using standard statistical methods, such as Cox regression.

#### &lt;span style="color: #2ca02c;"&gt;Study of Time-Varying Covariates&lt;/span&gt;

- When examining time-varying covariates, more careful consideration is essential.

---

### &lt;span style="color: #1f77b4;"&gt;Types of Time-Varying Covariates&lt;/span&gt;

- There are two types of time-varying covariates (Kalbfleisch &amp; Prentice, 2002):
  - **&lt;span style="color: #ff7f0e;"&gt;External (aka exogenous)&lt;/span&gt;:** The value of the covariate at time point t is not affected by the occurrence of an event at time point u, with t &gt; u.
  - **&lt;span style="color: #2ca02c;"&gt;Internal (aka endogenous)&lt;/span&gt;:** The covariate is not External.

- &lt;span style="color: #1f77b4;"&gt;Example: External vs. Internal&lt;/span&gt;

- This concept can be challenging to grasp, so let's clarify with an example...

---

#### &lt;span style="color: #1f77b4;"&gt;Example: Asthma Study&lt;/span&gt;

- Let's consider a study on asthma, specifically focusing on the time until an asthma attack for a group of patients.

- We have two time-varying covariates:
  - **&lt;span style="color: #ff7f0e;"&gt;Pollution levels&lt;/span&gt;**
  - **&lt;span style="color: #2ca02c;"&gt;A biomarker for asthma&lt;/span&gt;**

#### &lt;span style="color: #1f77b4;"&gt;Pollution Levels and Biomarker&lt;/span&gt;

- Suppose a patient had an asthma attack at a certain time point, denoted as u.

- For the time-varying covariates:
  - **&lt;span style="color: #ff7f0e;"&gt;Pollution levels:&lt;/span&gt;** The pollution levels at a time point t &gt; u will not be affected by the fact that the patient had an attack at u. (External)
  - **&lt;span style="color: #2ca02c;"&gt;Biomarker:&lt;/span&gt;** The biomarker level at a time point t &gt; u may be affected by the fact that the patient had an attack at u. (Internal)
  
---

#### &lt;span style="color: #1f77b4;"&gt;Distinguishing Covariate Types&lt;/span&gt;

- It's &lt;span style="color: #ff7f0e;"&gt;crucial&lt;/span&gt; to differentiate between these two types of time-varying covariates, as the type of covariate determines the appropriate analysis.

- In our motivating examples, all time-varying covariates are &lt;span style="color: #2ca02c;"&gt;Biomarkers&lt;/span&gt;. These are always &lt;span style="color: #2ca02c;"&gt;endogenous&lt;/span&gt; covariates:
  
  - &lt;span style="color: #ff7f0e;"&gt;Measured with error&lt;/span&gt; (i.e., biological variation)
  
  - The &lt;span style="color: #ff7f0e;"&gt;complete history is not available&lt;/span&gt;
  
  - Existence is &lt;span style="color: #ff7f0e;"&gt;directly related to failure status&lt;/span&gt;

---

### &lt;span style="color: #1f77b4;"&gt;Extension of Cox Model for Time-Varying Covariates&lt;/span&gt;

- The Cox model presented earlier can be extended to handle time-varying covariates using the counting process formulation:

`$$h_i(t | Y_i(t), w_i) = h_0(t)R_i(t) \exp\{ \gamma^T w_i +\color{#2ca02c}{ \alpha y_i(t)} \}$$`

where:
- `\(\color{blue}{N_i(t)}\)` is a counting process that tracks the number of events for subject `\(i\)` by time `\(t\)`,

- `\(h_i(t)\)` denotes the intensity process for `\(N_i(t)\)`,

- `\(R_i(t)\)` denotes the at-risk process (equals 1 if subject `\(i\)` is still at risk at time `\(t\)`),

- `\(\color{#2ca02c}{y_i(t)}\)`denotes the value of the time-varying covariate for subject `\(i\)` at time `\(t\)`.


- This formulation allows for the incorporation of time-varying covariates into the Cox model.

---

#### &lt;span style="color: #1f77b4;"&gt;Interpretation&lt;/span&gt;

The formulation:

`\(h_i(t | Y_i(t), w_i) = h_0(t)R_i(t) \exp\{ \gamma^T w_i + \alpha y_i(t) \}\)`

has the following interpretation:
- The term `\(\exp(\alpha)\)` denotes the &lt;span style="color: #2ca02c;"&gt;relative increase&lt;/span&gt; in the risk of an event at time `\(t\)` that results from a &lt;span style="color: #ff7f0e;"&gt;one-unit increase&lt;/span&gt; in `\(y_i(t)\)` at the &lt;span style="color: #ff7f0e;"&gt;same time point&lt;/span&gt;.

---

#### &lt;span style="color: #1f77b4;"&gt;Handling Time-Varying Covariates in the Extended Cox Model&lt;/span&gt;

The extended Cox model handles time-varying covariates as follows:
- It &lt;span style="color: #2ca02c;"&gt;assumes no measurement error&lt;/span&gt;.
- The covariate path is represented by a &lt;span style="color: #2ca02c;"&gt;step function&lt;/span&gt;.
- The &lt;span style="color: #2ca02c;"&gt;existence&lt;/span&gt; of the covariate is &lt;span style="color: #2ca02c;"&gt;not related to failure status&lt;/span&gt;.

**&lt;span style="color: #1f77b4;"&gt;Validity of the Extended Cox Model&lt;/span&gt;**

- The extended Cox model is &lt;span style="color: #2ca02c;"&gt;valid&lt;/span&gt; only for &lt;span style="color: #2ca02c;"&gt;exogenous time-varying covariates&lt;/span&gt;.

- Treating &lt;span style="color: #ff7f0e;"&gt;endogenous covariates&lt;/span&gt; as exogenous &lt;span style="color: #ff7f0e;"&gt;may produce spurious results&lt;/span&gt;!
---

### &lt;span style="color: #1f77b4;"&gt;Joint Modeling Framework&lt;/span&gt;

- To account for the special features of &lt;span style="color: #ff7f0e;"&gt;endogenous covariates&lt;/span&gt;, a new class of models has been developed: **Joint Models for Longitudinal and Time-to-Event Data**.

- The intuitive idea behind these models:
  1. Use an appropriate model to describe the &lt;span style="color: #2ca02c;"&gt;evolution of the covariate/marker&lt;/span&gt; over time for each patient.
  2. The &lt;span style="color: #2ca02c;"&gt;estimated evolutions&lt;/span&gt; are then used in a Cox model.

- A key feature of these models is that &lt;span style="color: #2ca02c;"&gt;covariate levels are not assumed constant between visits&lt;/span&gt;.

---

#### &lt;span style="color: #1f77b4;"&gt;Notation&lt;/span&gt;

- Some notation:
  - `\(\color{#ff7f0e}{T_i^*}\)`: True event time for patient `\(i\)`
 
  - `\(\color{#ff7f0e}{T_i}\)`: Observed event time for patient `\(i\)`
 
  - `\(\color{#ff7f0e}{\delta_i}\)`: Event indicator, i.e., equals 1 for true events
 
  - `\(\color{#2ca02c}{y_i}\)`: Longitudinal covariate
  
- We will formulate the joint model in 3 steps – in particular, . . .

---

#### &lt;span style="color: #1f77b4;"&gt;Step 1: Formulation of Joint Model&lt;/span&gt;

- Step 1: Let's assume that we know `\(\color{#ff7f0e}{m_i(t)}\)`, i.e., the true and unobserved value of the covariate at time `\(t\)`.

- With this assumption, we can define a &lt;span style="color: #2ca02c;"&gt;standard relative risk model&lt;/span&gt;:

  `$$h_i(t | M_i(t)) = h_0(t) \exp\{ \gamma^T w_i + \color{#ff7f0e}{\alpha m_i(t)} \},$$`
  where:
  
  - `\(\color{#ff7f0e}{M_i(t) = \{ m_i(s), 0 \leq s &lt; t \}}\)` represents the longitudinal history,
  
  - `\(\color{#2ca02c}{\alpha}\)` quantifies the association between the time-varying covariate and the risk of an event,
  
  - `\(\color{#ff7f0e}{w_i}\)` represents the baseline covariates.

---

#### &lt;span style="color: #1f77b4;"&gt;Step 2: Reconstructing Covariate History&lt;/span&gt;

- Step 2: From the observed longitudinal data `\(\color{#2ca02c}{y_i(t)}\)`, reconstruct the covariate history for each subject.

- We use a &lt;span style="color: #2ca02c;"&gt;mixed effects model&lt;/span&gt; to achieve this (focusing on continuous covariates for now):
 `$$y_i(t) = \color{blue}{m_i(t)} + \epsilon_i(t)$$`
  `$$= \color{blue}{x_i(t)^T \beta + z_i(t)^T b_i} + \epsilon_i(t),$$`
  where:
  
  - `\(\color{#ff7f0e}{x_i(t)}\)` and `\(\color{#ff7f0e}{\beta}\)`: Fixed-effects part,
 
  - `\(\color{blue}{z_i(t)}\)` and `\(\color{blue}{b_i}\)`: Random-effects part, `\(\color{#ff7f0e}{b_i \sim N(0, D)}\)`, `\(\color{#ff7f0e}{\epsilon_i(t) \sim N(0, \sigma^2)}\)`.

---

#### &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;Step 3: Associating the Two Processes and Defining a Joint Distribution Model&lt;/span&gt;

Joint models for associating two processes are often structured as follows (Tsiatis &amp; Davidian, Stat. Sinica, 2004):

The joint distribution is given by:
`$$p(y_i, T_i, \delta_i) = Z p(y_i | b_i) h(T_i | b_i)^{\delta_i} S(T_i | b_i) p(b_i) \, db_i,$$`

where:
- `\(b_i\)` is a vector of random effects that explains the interdependencies.

- `\(p(\cdot)\)` represents the density function.
- `\(S(\cdot)\)` represents the survival function.
- `\(Z\)` represents any normalizing constant.

This structure allows us to define a model for the joint distribution of the two processes.

---

#### &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;Analysis of a Real Data Example Using JM&lt;/span&gt;

- Consider a &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;longitudinal study&lt;/span&gt; on 467 HIV infected patients who had failed or were intolerant of zidovudine therapy.

- Aim:  &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;compare the efficacy and safety&lt;/span&gt; of two alternative antiretroviral drugs: **&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;didanosine (ddI) and zalcitabine (ddC)&lt;/span&gt;**.

- Patients were randomly assigned to receive either ddI or ddC, and &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;CD4 cell counts&lt;/span&gt; were recorded at study entry and at 2, 6, 12, and 18 months thereafter.
   - By the end of the study, &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;188 patients had died&lt;/span&gt;, resulting in &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;59.7% censoring&lt;/span&gt;.

- Our &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;main research question&lt;/span&gt; is to test for a treatment effect on survival after adjusting for the CD4 cell count.

- "The &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;CD4 cell count measurements&lt;/span&gt; are &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;generated by patients&lt;/span&gt; and are &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;only available at specific visit times&lt;/span&gt;. 
    - This situation exemplifies a typical &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;time-dependent covariate&lt;/span&gt;, measured &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;intermittently with error&lt;/span&gt;."

---

- The &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;longitudinal and survival information&lt;/span&gt; is available in the data frames `aids` and `aids.id` respectively.

- The CD4 cell counts exhibit &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;right-skewed distribution shapes&lt;/span&gt;; for analysis, we work with the &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;square root&lt;/span&gt; of the CD4 cell values.

- As a descriptive analysis, &lt;span style="color:purple"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/span&gt; shows &lt;span style="color:purple"&gt;subject-specific longitudinal profiles&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span style="color:purple"&gt;Kaplan-Meier estimate&lt;/span&gt; for time-to-death.

---

#### &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;Descriptive Analysis - Longitudinal Profiles and Survival&lt;/span&gt;

To perform a &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;descriptive analysis&lt;/span&gt; of the data, we can visualize the longitudinal profiles and survival curves using R and the `JM` and `lattice` libraries.


```r
library("JM"); library("lattice")
xyplot(sqrt(CD4) ~ obstime | drug, group = patient, data = aids,
       xlab = "Months", ylab = expression(sqrt("CD4")), col = 1, type = "l")
```

&lt;img src="joint-model2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---


```r
# Survival Curves
plot(survfit(Surv(Time, death) ~ drug, data = aids.id), conf.int = FALSE,
     mark.time = TRUE, col = c("black", "red"), lty = 1:2,
     ylab = "Survival", xlab = "Months")
legend("topright", c("ddC", "ddI"), lty = 1:2, col = c("black", "red"),
       bty = "n")
```

&lt;img src="joint-model2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

#### &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;Observations and Initial Analysis&lt;/span&gt;

- We observe that &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;both groups&lt;/span&gt; of patients exhibit &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;similar variability&lt;/span&gt; in their longitudinal profiles.

- However, from the &lt;span style="color:purple"&gt;Kaplan-Meier estimate &lt;/span&gt;, it appears that the &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;ddC group&lt;/span&gt; has slightly &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;higher survival&lt;/span&gt; than the ddI group after six months of follow-up.

- To highlight the advantages of the joint modelling approach, we will begin with a &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;'naive' analysis&lt;/span&gt;. 

- In this analysis, we &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;ignore the special characteristics&lt;/span&gt; of CD4 cell counts and fit a Cox model that includes the treatment indicator and CD4 as a typical time-dependent covariate.

---

- We will use the &lt;span style="color:orange"&gt;standard counting process form&lt;/span&gt; of the Cox model to fit this analysis:


```r
td.Cox &lt;- coxph(Surv(start, stop, event) ~ drug + sqrt(CD4), data = aids)
summary(td.Cox)
```

```

#### &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;Advanced Analysis - Fitting a Joint Model&lt;/span&gt;

- After adjusting for the &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;square root of CD4 count&lt;/span&gt; in the Cox model, &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;no strong evidence&lt;/span&gt; for a treatment effect is observed.

- We proceed by &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;specifying and fitting a joint model&lt;/span&gt; that explicitly postulates a linear mixed-effects model for CD4 cell counts.

- &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;Taking advantage&lt;/span&gt; of the randomization setup of the study, we include in the fixed-effects part of the &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;longitudinal submodel&lt;/span&gt; the main effect of time and the interaction of treatment with time.

- In the random-effects design matrix, we include an intercept and a time term.

- For the &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;survival submodel&lt;/span&gt; (similarly to the Cox model), we include the treatment effect as a time-independent covariate, and as a time-dependent one, the &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;true underlying effect&lt;/span&gt; of CD4 cell count estimated from the longitudinal model.

- The &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;baseline risk function&lt;/span&gt; is assumed piecewise constant with &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;six knots&lt;/span&gt; placed at equally spaced percentiles of the observed event times.

---

#### &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;Fitting the Joint Model&lt;/span&gt;

- To fit the joint model, a &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;two-step process&lt;/span&gt; is followed. First, the linear mixed-effects and Cox models are fitted &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;separately&lt;/span&gt;.

- The &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;returned objects&lt;/span&gt; from these separate fits are then used as main arguments in the `jointModel()` function.

- Importantly, the structure of the joint model for the &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;longitudinal and survival submodels&lt;/span&gt; mirrors that of the separately fitted models.

- In the survival submodel, the &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;estimated 'true' longitudinal outcome&lt;/span&gt; `\(m_i(t)\)` is incorporated into the linear predictor.

- Due to the fact that `jointModel()` extracts necessary information from these two objects, in the `coxph()` function call, we must specify `x = TRUE` to include the &lt;span style="color:orange"&gt;Cox model's design matrix&lt;/span&gt; in the returned object.

#### &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;Interpreting Joint Model Results&lt;/span&gt;

- The &lt;span style="color:orange"&gt;main argument `timeVar` of `jointModel()`&lt;/span&gt; specifies the name of the time variable in the linear mixed-effects model. 
  - This is vital for the computation of `\(m_i(t)\)`.

- The `summary()` method &lt;span style="color:orange"&gt;provides a detailed output&lt;/span&gt;, including parameter estimates, their standard errors, and asymptotic Wald tests for both the longitudinal and survival submodels.

- In the &lt;span style="color:purple"&gt;event process results&lt;/span&gt;, the parameter labeled **Assoct** corresponds to parameter `\(\alpha\)`. 
   - It measures the effect of `\(m_i(t)\)` (in our case, the true square root CD4 cell count) on the risk of death. 

The parameters `\(x_i\)` are (for `\(i = 1, \ldots, 7\)`) parameters for the piecewise constant baseline risk function.

---

- A comparison between the &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;standard time-dependent Cox model&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span style="color:green"&gt;joint model&lt;/span&gt; reveals interesting features.

- The regression coefficient for &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;ddI is larger in magnitude&lt;/span&gt; in the joint model, indicating a slightly &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;stronger treatment effect&lt;/span&gt;.

- A significant &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;bias&lt;/span&gt; is observed for the &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;CD4 cell count effect&lt;/span&gt;. 

- In the time-dependent Cox model, the estimated regression coefficient is `\(-0.72\)`, whereas in the joint model, it's `\(-1.10\)`.

- For obtaining the Hazard Ratio for this variable we have to exponenciate the value exposed in the table. 
- In this case the result is 0.33. According to this, one unit increse on the CD4 count cell decreases the risk 67%.

#### &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;Alternative Test - Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT)&lt;/span&gt;

- The &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT)&lt;/span&gt; provides an alternative to the Wald test for hypothesis testing.

- After fitting the joint model under the null hypothesis of &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;no treatment effect&lt;/span&gt; in the survival submodel, we can use the &lt;span style="color:orange"&gt;`anova()` method&lt;/span&gt; to perform the LRT:


```r
# Null Hypothesis Testing
fitSURV2 &lt;- coxph(Surv(Time, death) ~ 1, data = aids.id, x = TRUE)
fitJM2 &lt;- jointModel(fitLME, fitSURV2, timeVar = "obstime", method = "piecewise-PH-GH")
anova(fitJM2, fitJM) # The model under the null is the first one
```

```
## 
##            AIC     BIC  log.Lik  LRT df p.value
## fitJM2 4250.53 4312.72 -2110.26                
## fitJM  4247.29 4313.64 -2107.65 5.23  1  0.0222
```

- According to the `pvalue` (as with the Wald test) we arrive to the same conclusion, there exist an affect of the treatment on the risk.
---
- Additionally, if we want to obtain estimates of the Hazard Ratio with confidence intervals for the final model it is possible ti apply the `confint` function to the created object


```r
confint(fitJM, parm = "Event")
```

```
##               2.5 %       est.     97.5 %
## drugddI  0.04979688  0.3511323  0.6524677
## Assoct  -1.33281297 -1.1016129 -0.8704128
```

```r
exp(confint(fitJM, parm = "Event"))
```

```
##             2.5 %      est.    97.5 %
## drugddI 1.0510576 1.4206752 1.9202736
## Assoct  0.2637343 0.3323346 0.4187786
