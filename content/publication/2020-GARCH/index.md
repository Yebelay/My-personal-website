abstract: "Gaming disorder (also known as dysregulated gaming) has received significant research and policy attention based on concerns that certain patterns of play are associated with decreased mental well-being and/or functional impairment. In this study, we use specification curve analysis to examine analytical flexibility and the strength of the relationship between dysregulated gaming and well-being in the form of general mental health, depressive mood, and life satisfaction. Dutch and Flemish gamers (n = 424) completed ﬁve unique dysregulated gaming measures (covering nine scale variants) and three well-being measures. We find a consistent negative relationship; across 972 justifiable regression models, the median standardized regression coefficient was –0.40 (min: –0.54, max: –0.19). Data show that the majority of dysregulated gaming operationalizations converge upon highly similar estimates of well-being (i.e. have similar concurrent validity). However, variance is introduced by the choice of well-being measure; results indicate that dysregulated gaming is more strongly associated with depressive mood than with life satisfaction. Weekly gametime accounted for little to no unique variance in well-being in the sample. We argue that research on this topic should compare a broad range of functional and well-being outcomes, and work to identify a maximally parsimonious of dysregulated gaming criteria. Given somewhat minute differences between dysregulated gaming scales when used in survey-based studies and largely equivalent relationships with mental health indicators, harmonization of measurement should be a priority."
