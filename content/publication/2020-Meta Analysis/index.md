abstract: "Background: Unintended pregnancy has significant consequences for the health and welfare of women and children. Despite this, a number of studies with inconsistent findings were conducted to reduce unintended pregnancy in Ethiopia; unavailability of a nationwide study that deter-mines the prevalence of unintended pregnancy and its determinants is an important research gap. Thus, this study was conducted to determine the overall prevalence of unintended pregnancy and its determinants in Ethiopia. Methods: We searched from Google Scholar, PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library databases for studies. Each of the original studies was assessed using a tool for the risk of bias of observational studies. The heterogeneity of studies was also assessed using I2test statistics. Data were pooled and a random effect meta-analysis model was fitted to provide the overall prevalence of unintended pregnancy and its determinants in Ethiopia. In addition, the subgroup analyses were performed to investigate how the prevalence of unintended pregnancy varies across different groups of studies. Results: Twenty-eight studies that satisfy the eligibility criteria were included. We found that the over-all prevalence of unintended pregnancy in Ethiopia was 28% (95% CI: 26-31). The sub-group analyses showed that the highest prevalence of unintended pregnancy was observedfrom the Oromiya region (33.8%) followed by Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples'region (30.6%) and the lowest was in Harar. In addition, the pooled prevalence of unintended pregnancy was 26.4% (20.8-32.4) and 30.0% (26.6-33.6) for community-based cross-sectional and institution-based cross-sectional studies respectively. The pooled anal-ysis showed that not communicating with one's husband about family planning was more likely to lead to unintended pregnancy (OR: 3.56, 95%CI: 1.68-7.53). The pooled odds ratio also showed that unintended pregnancy is more likely among women who never use family planning methods (OR: 2.08, 95%CI: 1.18-3.69). Furthermore, the narrative review of this study showed that maternal education, age, and household wealth index are strongly associated with an unintended pregnancy. Conclusions: In this study, the prevalence of unintended pregnancy was high. Lack of spousal communication, never using family planning, maternal education, and household wealth level were significantly associated with an unintended pregnancy. This study implies the need to develop plans and policies to improve the awareness of contraceptive utilization and strengthen spousal communication related to pregnancy."
